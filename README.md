## Super Pizza Client

Web app for super pizzas is created using `create-react-app` library.
Running `npm run build` gives you a `bundle` directory with optimized static content which can be copied to the public directory of any backend server.
Steps to deploy this app with Laravel are given [here](https://github.com/abhijitghogre/super-pizza-server/blob/master/README.md).
